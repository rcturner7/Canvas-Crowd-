# Canvas-Crowd-Simulator

Found this Canvas/html project as I advance in my learning path in html.

This project makes image characters with no background to move and dance across the webpage.
I created a sprite sheet of the upcoming NFT Launch as a learning project by taking out the backgrounds of the characters and editing them to a png sprite sheet.
I then uploaded sprite sheet to IPFS, and in the code I put the url/gateway of the spritesheet to pull those characters to the webpage to dance and move across the screen.

To check out the work go to www.solcitizens.club 
click on the mint button on the menu top right, and you will see the images dancing.





The canvas html code was in reference for incorporating my own changing and altering code to my ideas.
